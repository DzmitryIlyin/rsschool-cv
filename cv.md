3. Test automation engineer with 5+ years of experience in EPAM Systems company. Started as Test engineer and then in about 2.5 years switched to automation discipline by passing internal EPAM course. At some point decided to try myself in development, particularly in iOS (I know that Android seems much more logical, but due to the reason I was looking for a new challenge decided to go with iOS) due to current project provides the possibility to switch to a new position smoothly; of course in case if I completely pass RSSchool iOS course :)
4. Experience in following languages:
*Mainly used language  is Java. I have experience working with GitHub which was also used by several test automation engineers (means created PR's, its reviews etc.). Touched Spring Java framework and widely used Google Guice dependency injection.
*Also had some experience creating Chrome plugin which is JS based
All the project which I was part of used Scrum methodology.

```java
class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}  
```
6. Created several test automation frameworks were created by me from the scratch (for API, UI, Mobile testing) as well as spent time supporting and extending existing test automation solution. Unfortunately due to policy I cannot share source code of those solutions. However some code samples available in my GitHub with only mentions that they too outdated :)
7. Finished Belarusian National Technical University as specialist in Industrial Heat Power Engineering, after 2 years working in that area decided to switch to IT field, passed IT-academy courses and got invite from EPAM and since that time I've been working there.
8. Based on recently passed EPAM assessment my English level is B2, but I believe there's always room for improvement. Attended internal company courses only once, but plan to have more.
